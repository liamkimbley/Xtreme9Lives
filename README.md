### Description
This assignment was designed to simulate a full CRUD Spring REST operation. The front end and the database were designed by one of the instructors. We were required to implement the back end and connect it to both the front end and the database. This was to illustrate the separation of the client from the server using REST principles.

This was our first exposure to Spring REST.

### Technologies Used
* Spring REST
* Jackson Jar
* JPA Repositories
* Services
* Query DSL
